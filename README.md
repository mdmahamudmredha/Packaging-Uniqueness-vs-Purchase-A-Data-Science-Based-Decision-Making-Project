# Packaging-Uniqueness-vs-Purchase-A-Data-Science-Based-Decision-Making-Project

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to explore whether the uniqueness of packaging for a Dog Food product influences customer purchase decisions. A survey of 523 respondents was conducted to gather insights on the perceived uniqueness of packaging and the likelihood of purchasing the product based on that packaging.

### ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

A Dog Food Company has introduced a new packaging design. While the marketing and design teams consider it very unique and appealing, the product manager is concerned about its impact on sales, especially due to potential logistics challenges. This project investigates whether there is a statistically significant relationship between packaging uniqueness and purchase intent.

### ðŸ§  Objective

- Understand if the perceived uniqueness of packaging impacts purchase likelihood.

- Use statistical analysis to support business decision-making.

### ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

The dataset contains survey responses with the following columns:

Uniqueness: Categorical values representing how unique the packaging is (Extremely unique, Very unique, Somewhat likely, Not so likely, Not at all likely).

Purchase Likelihood: Categorical values showing the likelihood of purchasing the product based on packaging(Extremely unique, Very unique, Somewhat unique, Not so unique, Not at all unique).

### ðŸ§ª Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed several EDA steps including:

- Checked for missing values and confirmed dataset cleanliness.

- Value counts for both Uniqueness and Purchase Likelihood variables.

- Created a contingency table (cross-tabulation) to explore the distribution.

- Visualized relationships using heatmaps (annotated) for better understanding.

- Bar plots to show the frequency of each category in both variables.

- Clustered bar chart to compare Uniqueness with Purchase Likelihood directly.

- Countplots to observe how each uniqueness level affects purchase intent.

- Analyzed dominant combinations of values in the crosstab.

- Observed trends/patterns in customer preferences visually.

- Prepared the data for statistical testing (Chi-square assumptions checked).
