# Packaging-Uniqueness-vs-Purchase-A-Data-Science-Based-Decision-Making-Project

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to explore whether the uniqueness of packaging for a Dog Food product influences customer purchase decisions. A survey of 523 respondents was conducted to gather insights on the perceived uniqueness of packaging and the likelihood of purchasing the product based on that packaging.

### ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

A Dog Food Company has introduced a new packaging design. While the marketing and design teams consider it very unique and appealing, the product manager is concerned about its impact on sales, especially due to potential logistics challenges. This project investigates whether there is a statistically significant relationship between packaging uniqueness and purchase intent.
