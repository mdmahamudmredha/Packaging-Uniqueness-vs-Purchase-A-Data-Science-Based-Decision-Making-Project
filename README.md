# Packaging-Uniqueness-vs-Purchase-A-Data-Science-Based-Decision-Making-Project

### 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to explore whether the uniqueness of packaging for a Dog Food product influences customer purchase decisions. A survey of 523 respondents was conducted to gather insights on the perceived uniqueness of packaging and the likelihood of purchasing the product based on that packaging.
